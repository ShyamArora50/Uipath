Shyam,

As discussed, I notified you on Sunday 23rd June early morning to book Monday 24th June as vacation/non-chargeable day, because there would be a problem in accelerating the workflow to enable your access.

Given this advanced notification, I was not expecting you to turn up at SABIC HQ. Hence from my side, I cannot justify approval of the timesheet.

Happy to discuss with your supervisor if need be.

Regards,
Mohsin
